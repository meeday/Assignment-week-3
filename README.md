## Summary

The application is a password generator that generates a random password based on the preferences of the user. #
The HTML and CSS were already written, however I added a clipboard button to copy password to the HTML and the css had conflicting border styling which I refactored. Screenshots are included in the repository to illustrate the application

### How to use the application
* click on the link to the deployed application which will load a simple page consisting of a box and two buttons: one button says generate button and the other has a clipboard icon.

* The user starts by clicking the generate password button which will trigger a prompt to ask the user to specify the desired length of their password. the value has to be between 8 and 128 otherwise the user will not be able to progress.

* Once a value that meets the stated conditions is entered the user is then given a series of confirm prompts. This is where the user selects the criteria for their password. i.e
    - if you want your password to contain lowercase letters
    - if you want your password to contain uppercase letters
    - if you want your password to contain numbers
    - if you want your password to contain special characters

**Note** 
User must select at least one of the above criteria otherwise the user will have to start the process again

* Once user has selected criteria a random password will be generated and will be presented in place of the 'your secure password' placeholder

* If the user wishes to copy the generated password to their clipboard then the user can click the clipboard button to copy their password to the clipboard
